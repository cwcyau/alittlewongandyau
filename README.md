# Little, Yau and Wong

## A journey through data science and all the bits we forgot to tell you about

**Coming this Autumn 2024**

This training course provides everything Yau need to know about health data: why does it go Wong, why do we have such Little impact? 

This is a unique opportunity for doctoral students to learn from the bitter insights of three middle-aged men armed with decades worth of experience in what people now call "data science". 

Our ramblings will cover:

- What are "models" really and why are there so many of them?

- Why do models not work in the real world? Why don't they work at all sometimes?

- Why are the problems you face now, the same ones we faced when we were students?

What will you learn? Maybe we will put you off academia for life? Or maybe we will enlighten you with knowledge and experience that you won't find in textbooks or research papers.
